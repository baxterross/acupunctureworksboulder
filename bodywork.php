								Asian Bodywork Therapy describes a number of the traditions of bodywork utilized in the practice of Oriental medicine.  The bodywork we do at <b>acupunctureWorks</b> is basically manual therapy applied in the context of an acupuncture treatment, however there are some important differences between what we do and what is typically practiced as massage therapy.  Bodywork as a branch of Oriental medicine is really therapeutic touch applied within a specific Oriental medical diagnostic framework.   Oriental medicine is a system of medical treatment that includes, acupuncture, bodywork, herbs, Qi exercises, and diet therapy.  And we utilize all five of these systems of treatment in our practice.
								<br><br>
								At <b>acupunctureWorks</b> we provide bodywork as a part of each and every treatment.  Bodywork is really the original medical intervention - when something hurts, we instinctively touch it.  And this is how bodywork evolved, by harnessing healing touch as a response to pain.  Bodywork provides a marvelous adjunct to acupuncture by helping the body to amalgamate the needle work, and by helping to accomplish some of the goals of the treatment in its own right.  For example, if you come in to our office seeking treatment for chronic headaches, we will address your condition from multiple directions:  needling to address both the region of your body involved with the headaches as well as treating the underlying energetic patterns responsible for causing the headaches, and bodywork in areas that are related to the headaches, such as neck, shoulders, upper & lower back, jaw, head, etc.  The handwork makes an enormous difference in conditions like this, and in every condition involving pain.  It also helps other conditions too, such as stress, insomnia, digestive problems, and reproductive disorders. 
								<br><br>
								We believe that bodywork is an essential part of a treatment, and perform varying degrees of it on every person, every treatment, no exceptions.  This is because it's so valuable in the process of improving health conditions.  Even though most acupuncturists don't do any handwork at all on their patients, we emphasize it as part of a full treatment, because our years of experience have shown us that patients who receive bodywork as part of their treatment get positive results faster, and hold onto those results longer.  In fact, in our training, we were taught to treat with our hands firsts, before leaning to use needles, so that the needle work then becomes an extension of the hand work.  Rather than just fitting a little bodywork in around an acupuncture treatment, we are building an acupuncture treatment around a bodywork treatment.  The result is a powerful combination of the two, that creates quick and lasting changes in the body.  Good palpatory skills are paramount to good needling skills, and the practitioners at <b>acupunctureWorks</b> focus on utilizing traditional Asian bodywork to great effect.
								<br><br>
								Much of the bodywork we practice is Japanese in origin, and includes, such styles as acupressure, Shiatsu, Anma, Amma, Teate, Saikai Hon Li, Kappo, and a number of other techniques.  We also include bodywork techniques from China and Korea, such as Tuina, as well as Manual Therapeutics and some basic structural bodywork techniques.  These styles of bodywork provide great flexibility for the practitioners to address nearly any kind of condition productively using handwork along with needle work to accomplish the most for your health.
								<br><br>
								Hara work is another very important and relatively unique aspect of the bodywork we utilize at <b>acupunctureWorks</b>.  Hara is the Japanese word for abdomen, and treating the hara consistently is key to improving many internal conditions.  If you take the body and narrow it down, you can see how important the hara is - the limbs are simply about locomotion, the head is primarily the central nervous system, and the chest is basically our cardiovascular system.  And while these are indeed crucial aspects of our bodies, it's important to realized that virtually everything else in the body is happening in the abdomen.  Treating the hara helps every condition to improve more quickly, and with longer lasting results.  Hara work improves deep circulation and alleviates stagnation in areas that most people are pretty unaware of.  It also improves our breathing, our digestion and our ability to assimilate nourishment from food, as well as helping us to maintain a health weight.  Indeed, consistent hara work unties many of the knots we carry around in our bodies.

								Bodywork is a very important aspect of Oriental medicine, and one we value highly.  It adds so much to the treatment experience, and we have patients tell us again and again how much they love the bodywork they get from us.  There's nothing like finishing up your acupuncture treatment with a solid foot massage!  We typically work on your neck and shoulders, your back, your hara, and your feet and legs in every session, and do many other specialized bodywork techniques to address specific conditions.  And this is all done in addition to your acupuncture treatment, as a part of it.  Call today for more information on our techniques, training, and experience, and come see how our bodywork skills can help you to maximize your health improvement goals.
