								People who have never experienced acupuncture before are often a little unsure of it.  Sticking needles into people to promote health can seem a bit counter intuitive at first.  But acupuncture is a very effective way of controlling & dealing with many different health problems. 
								<br><br>
								Acupuncture is a method of treatment used in Oriental medicine that involves the insertion of small needles into the surface of the body at specific locations to improve health by balancing the body\'s energy.  Acupuncture is based on the idea of Qi (pronounced "chee"), also referred to as life energy.  This energy is essentially the difference between a person & a corpse - one is full of activity, while the other is not.  The energy in the body is divided into numerous different aspects, all the different jobs our body does - everything from digesting food, to keeping us warm, to thinking and acting in the outside world. 
								<br><br>
								In a healthy body, all the different aspects of our body work together as harmonious members of a smooth functioning whole, not unlike all the different instruments in a symphony - each has its part and contributes exactly what is needed at just the right time to produce harmonious results.  But we are subject to numerous stressors, less than ideal dietary conditions, poor lifestyle choices, inherited deficiencies, and other such factors.  These things tax our system, putting pressure on it from numerous different directions, overworking various aspects of our bodies resources. 
								<br><br>
								Over time, some aspects of our body\'s energy can become significantly overworked and are then unable to do their jobs as efficiently as they might.  This in turn can force another aspect of the body to overwork, setting off a chain reaction of imbalance in the body.  This energetic imbalance in the body slowly works its way forward and manifests as symptoms.  It is the level of this balance or imbalance in the body\'s energetic resources that determines the body\'s level of health.  We may still be able to accomplish many things, even while we\'re not taking the best care of ourselves, but using our resources at a less than optimal level will eventually lead serious health problems.  Once our body is unable to use its resources to the best of its ability, we end up getting sick.  
								<br><br>
								Acupuncture uses needles to stimulate specific points on the body that are related to these different aspects of the body\'s energy.  When you touch someone, with a finger or a needle, it calls their body\'s attention to that place.  With this awareness, energy moves.  This movement creates very specific intended change in the body\'s ability to utilize its resources.  Movement + intention = change.  The effect is to remind the body of a different and better way to use its energy, so the body can take better care of itself.  Acupuncture ultimately doesn\'t fix people, instead it allows the body to fix itself.  While symptom alleviation is always an important goal, it is ultimately just a partner to creating a healthy body from the inside out, one that can manage its own resources and solve its own problems.  
								<br><br>
								Acupuncture can provide quick and very thorough solutions to numerous health problems.  While acupuncture is widely recognized for its ability to treat pain, it is by no means limited to symptom alleviation.  Acupuncture can control a wide variety of health problems, including all types of digestive disorders, female reproductive issues (including infertility), pre- and post-natal care, insomnia, asthma, allergies, immune enhancement, athletic performance, musculo-skeletal issues, hypertension, emotional health, and many, many other conditions.
								<br><br>
								Acupuncture is a relatively light intervention with virtually no side effects, unlike many prescription medications, and it\'s a phenomenally effective way for people to control their health naturally with results that endure.  Many people come to acupuncture after having limited help with other more typical forms of medical treatment, including allopathic medicine, and find that there is an entire world of very productive health care options waiting for them with acupuncture.  Acupuncture has something to offer everyone, from those wishing to enhance their athletic performance to those managing a terminal disease, and everyone in between.  It allows you body to make best use of its resources so that you can do your best in any given situation.  Don\'t wait until you\'re sick, discover how to maximize your health and build for your future now.
