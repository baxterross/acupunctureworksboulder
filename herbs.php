								Chinese herbology is an important and very effective part of Oriental medicine.  Herbs can have a tremendous impact on a condition, offering steady and reliable improvement for many patients.  Chinese herbology is tied into the same diagnostic principals used in acupuncture, and utilizes a large group of specific plants to influence the body and carry out treatment goals.  Every substance has energetic properties, and Chinese herbology takes advantage of these properties to influence the body's energy so that the body can make better use of its resources and take better care of itself.  In diagnosing someone, we look at the energy in the body, all the different aspects of what the body does, and decide which parts are not doing their jobs well enough, discovering the patterns of disharmony that are producing the symptoms.  We can then use herbal combinations to address these energetic patterns of disharmony so the body will stop producing symptoms.  For example, if headaches are the problem, we first ascertain the reason for the headaches, such as blood or yin deficiency patterns in the body, or perhaps too much yang energy rising up to the head, or stagnation of energy creating constraint.  We can then address these patterns with specific and customized herbal formulas to induce change in the body's energetic patterns so that the pathological patterns resolve and are no longer capable of producing symptoms.

								Chinese herbs are a marvelously effective way to improve many health conditions, and offer a very powerful compliment to acupuncture treatment.  Herbs are particularly useful for conditions involving internal patterns of disharmony, including female reproductive disorders, headaches, insomnia, digestive disorders, body temperature imbalances, fatigue, chronic illnesses, immunity conditions, colds & flus, and numerous other conditions.  Chinese herbal formulas used in combination with acupuncture treatment can dramatically speed up the progress of treatment, and offer a solid continuity of care.
